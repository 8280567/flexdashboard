The examples below illustrate the use of flexdashboard with various packages and layouts. If you want to learn more about how the dashboards were created each example includes a link to it's source code. 

## htmlwidgets

These examples are dashboards built as regular R Markdown documents (i.e. they are a simple webpage that can be deployed to any web server). Each of them use [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.com) to provide direct interaction with charts on the dashboard.
