## flexdashboard: Easy interactive dashboards for R

* Use [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) to publish a group of related data visualizations as a dashboard.

* Ideal for publishing interactive JavaScript visualizations based on [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org) (also works with standard base, lattice, and grid graphics).

* Flexible and easy to specify layouts, including automatic sizing of charts to fill the browser.

* Optionally use [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) to drive visualizations dynamically.
