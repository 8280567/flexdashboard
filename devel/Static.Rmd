X11 starts a graphics device driver for the X Window System (version 11). This can only be done on machines/accounts that have access to an X server.

x11 is recognized as a synonym for X11.

The R function is a wrapper for two devices, one based on Xlib (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xlib) and one using cairographics (http://www.cairographics.org).
