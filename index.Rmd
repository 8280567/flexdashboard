* Use [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) to publish a group of related data visualizations as a dashboard.

* Ideal for publishing interactive JavaScript visualizations based on [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org).

* Flexible and easy to specify layouts, including automatic re-sizing of charts to fill available browser space.

* Optionally use [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) to drive visualizations dynamically.

## Getting Started

Install the **flexdashboard** package from GitHub as follows:

```r
devtools::install_github("rstudio/flexdashboard")
```

To author a flexdashboard you create an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) document with the `flexdashboard::flex_dashboard` output format. You can do this from within RStudio using the **New R Markdown** dialog:

<img src="images/NewRMarkdown.png" width="579" height="465"/>

If you are not using RStudio, you can create a new `flexdashboard` R Markdown file from the R console:

```r
rmarkdown::draft("dashboard.Rmd", template = "flex_dashboard", package = "flexdashboard")
```

## Dashboard Basics

You can use flexdashboard to publish groups of related data visualizations as a dashboard. A flexdashboard can either be static (a standard web page) or dynamic (a [Shiny](shiny.html) interactive document).

One of the most important characteristics of flexdashboard is the automatic scaling of charts to fit available browser width and (optionally) browser height. This makes flexdashboard ideal for publishing [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org) since these widgets automatically re-size themselves to their containers.

You can also use flexdashboard to publish base, lattice, and ggplot2 graphics. These charts are also automatically resized to fit their containers within dynamic (Shiny) dashboards; in static dashboards, however, a bit more work is required to ensure that they are properly scaled (see [Figure Sizes and Scaling](using.html#figure-sizes-and-scaling)).

### Single Column Layout

Dashboards are divided into columns and rows. By default, columns are defined using level 2 markdown headers (`------------------`) and charts are defined using level 3 headers (`###`). Charts are stacked vertically within a column. For example, this layout defines a single column with three charts:

<div class="row">

<div class="col-md-5">
<div id="singlecolumn"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">loadSnippet('singlecolumn')</script>
</div>

<div class="col-md-7">
<div height="470px" width="100%">
<img class="holder" src="holder.js/100px157?size=28&amp;text=Chart 1">
<img class="holder" src="holder.js/100px157?size=28&amp;text=Chart 2">
<img class="holder" src="holder.js/100px157?size=28&amp;text=Chart 3">
</div>
</div>

</div>


### Multiple Column Layout

To add a second column of charts we just add another column section:

<div class="row">

<div class="col-md-5">
<div id="multiplecolumns"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">loadSnippet('multiplecolumns')</script>
</div>

<div class="col-md-7">
<div height="500px" width="100%">
<div style="float: left; width: 60%;">
<img class="holder" src="holder.js/100px500?size=28&amp;text=Chart 1">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 60%;">
<img class="holder" src="holder.js/100px250?size=28&amp;text=Chart 2">
<img class="holder" src="holder.js/100px250?size=28&amp;text=Chart 3">
</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>


In this example we've moved **Chart 1** into its own column which it will fill entirely. Since we only have one or two charts vertically stacked, we've also specified the `fill_page: true` option to automatically scale the charts to the full height of the page. Finally, we've given the column a larger size via the `data-width` attribute to provide additional emphasis to Chart 1.

## Learning More

The [Using](using.html) page includes documentation on all of the features and options of flexdashboard, including layout orientations (row vs. column based), chart sizing, text annotations, theming, and creating dashboards with multiple pages.

The [Shiny](shiny.html) page describes how to create dashboards that automatically update themselves as the underlying data changes, or allow viewers to change parameters and see the results immediately.

The [Layouts](layouts.html) page includes a variety of sample layouts which you can use as a starting point for your own dashboards.
