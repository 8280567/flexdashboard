title: "Using Shiny with flexdashboard"
---

## Overview

By adding [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) to a flexdashboard, you can create dashboards that enable viewers to change underlying parameters and see the results immediately. This is done by adding `runtime: shiny` to a standard flexdashboard and then adding one or more input controls that dynamically drive the appearance of the charts within the dashboard.

Using Shiny with flexdashboard turns a static R Markdown report into an [Interative Document](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_shiny.html). It's important to note that interactive documents need to be [deployed](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_shiny.html#deployment) to a Shiny Server to be shared broadly (whereas static R Markdown documents are standalone web pages that can be attached to emails or served from any standard web server).

### Requirements

The steps required to add Shiny components to a flexdashboard are as follows:

1. Add `runtime: shiny` to the options declared at the top of the document (YAML front matter).

2. Add the `{.sidebar}` attribute to the first column of the dashboard to make it a host for Shiny input controls (note this step isn't strictly required but nearly all Shiny based dashboards will want to do this).

3. Add Shiny inputs and output as appropriate. 

A simple example of a Shiny based flexdashboard is provided below. 

## Example

The following example demonstrates the basics of using Shiny within a flexdashboard:

<img src="images/Shiny.png" width="865" height="745"/>

### Source Code

Here's the source code for the example. Note that since we have only a single chart as output we definitely want it to fill all of the available space. To accomplish this we add `fill_page: true` to the output options.

<div id="shiny"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">loadSnippet('shiny')</script>

The first column ("Inputs") includes the `{.sidebar}` attribute and the Shiny input controls; the second column ("Outputs") includes the Shiny code required to render the chart based on the inputs.
